# Credit-card-fraud-detection-system
In this project, proposed a system that detect a fraud in credit card transactions. In recent time, digitization is increasing day to day. Many people is using digital money instead of hard money. So, here comes the fraud system. Credit card companies shall be able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. Throughout the financial sector, machine learning algorithms are being developed to detect fraudulent transactions. Using a dataset of nearly 28,500 credit card transactions and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, we are going to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud. In this project, we will build and deploy the two algorithms Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and Isolation Forest Algorithm.
